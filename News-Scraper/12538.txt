Is Biden Still The Democratic Party's Best Bet for 2024?

Biden’s “Armageddon” Comment: Reckless Escalation or Fair Warning?
*LEFT*President Joe Biden’s warning that the world is at risk of a nuclear “Armageddon” was designed to send an unvarnished message that no one should underestimate the extraordinary danger if Russia deploys tactical nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, administration officials said Friday.The president’s grim assessment, delivered during a Democratic fundraiser on Thursday night, rippled around the globe and appeared to edge beyond the boundaries of current U.S. intelligence assessments.

Is White Supremacy the “Most Dangerous Terrorist Threat” as Biden Suggests?
*LEFT*In a commencement address delivered at Howard University in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, President Joe Biden correctly deemed white supremacy “the most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland.” He was quick to add that he wasn’t saying this just because he was speaking at a historically Black university. “I say it wherever I go,” he added.Biden is right to highlight the threat from violent white supremacists, who federal law enforcement agencies say “promote accelerationist thinking, which advocates committing violence to precipitate a large-scale conflict often framed as a race war” in order to establish a “white...*CENTER*It's no wonder President Joe Biden was at Howard University last week.

In a recent speech to graduating seniors at Howard University, the octogenarian pol described “white supremacy” as the “most dangerous terrorist threat” — at least on the domestic front — to the United States. That’s arguably true, but it’s worth unpacking what exactly this means, and why Uncle Joe was so eager to announce it.It is actually accurate that, largely because riot and “common crime” deaths do not count toward terror-death totals (“terrorism,”...

Biden Holds Post-Election Press Conference, Takes Questions
*LEFT*President Joe Biden reveled in his party’s success on Wednesday, declaring it a good day for democracy and “a good day for America.”His comments came after Democrats defied expectations of a red wave washing across the country and exceeded their most optimistic predictions about the midterms.“Our democracy has been tested in recent years, but with their votes, the American people have spoken and proven once again that democracy is who we are,” he said after walking into the State Dining Room to address reporters.Biden aides and close...*CENTER*President Biden on Wednesday called impeachment threats from some House Republicans poised to take control of the chamber “almost comedy,” arguing that the American people are not interested in investigations into him and his family.“It was reported—whether it’s accurate or not, I’m not sure—but it was reported many times that Republicans are saying and the former president said, how many times you’re gonna impeach Biden?” Biden said at a post-midterm election press conference at the White House. “I think the American people will look at all of that for...*RIGHT*President Biden on Wednesday admitted that he plans to do “nothing” differently in the second half of his first term to restore Americans’ confidence in the direction of their country, despite the possibility that Republicans reclaim a majority in the House after an otherwise lackluster midterm performance.Speaking to reporters the day after the midterm elections, Biden was asked what he might do differently to address voters’ concerns about the economy and the widespread sentiment that the country is generally moving in the wrong direction.Biden replied: “nothing.”“I’m not going to change...
How Will Biden's Visit to Kyiv Impact the Ukraine War?
*LEFT*Kennedy and then Reagan in Berlin. Now Biden in Kyiv.Periodically during the past sixty years, American presidents have stood up at the Eastern edge of Europe and looked to Russia to say, “We stand with our allies.

And Ukraine strands. Democracy stands.”Stirringly, just days ahead of the one year anniversary of Russia’s brutal offensive against...*CENTER*An American AWACS began patrolling the skies west of Ukraine last night; Kyiv was locked down this morning.

He’s the American president. He made an unprecedented trip to a war zone, one where there are no U.S. troops...*RIGHT*President Biden is in Kyiv, Ukraine, today. Good for him for accepting the small but undeniable risk of traveling to a country currently being invaded by Russia to demonstrate U.S. support for those beleaguered people. Our Mark Wright observes that, “Neither the U.S. nor Ukraine has total control of the airspace. Neither the U.S. nor Ukraine could guarantee Biden’s security on the ground. The president of the United States was inside the Russian WEZ — the weapons engagement zone — the entire trip. For that Joe Biden should receive credit.”...

Hunter Biden Reportedly Clashes With Father's Aides Amid Mounting Legal Challenges
*LEFT*Top aides to President Biden have clashed with Hunter Biden's team over strategies for dealing with the legal battles and Republican attacks that surround the president's son.Why it matters: The tensions led Hunter — without involving the president's top aides — to hire prominent lawyer Abbe Lowell in December, as part of a plan to take a more combative approach than the White House and Hunter's previous lawyer had taken.Hunter's team also is moving toward creating a legal defense fund, and hiring ethics advisers for it. High-level Democrats and others are...*CENTER*After a multiyear investigation into Hunter Biden, prosecutors could be close to sharing any possible results with the public and whether the president’s son will face any criminal charges. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that people familiar with the matter said prosecutors are close to a decision on whether to charge Biden with possible tax-related and gun-related legal violations.The news came after his legal team reportedly met with the Justice Department (DOJ) to discuss possible charges that Biden might be facing. Biden first announced in December 2020 that the U.S. attorney’s office in...*RIGHT*Hunter Biden’s advisers are clashing with Joe Biden’s White House over the first son’s legal defense strategy amid ongoing congressional and federal investigations into his financial affairs.The latest flashpoint is Hunter’s proposed creation of a legal defense fund that would help pay for the 53-year-old’s high-priced lawyers, among them longtime Democratic fixer Abbe Lowell.Axios reports that the fund could complicate Hunter’s efforts to ward off House Oversight Committee Republicans investigating the Biden family’s influence-peddling abroad — especially if contributions come from foreign entities.
President Biden Criticized for Not Acknowledging Seventh Grandchild
*LEFT*Joe Biden recently unveiled the term “Bidenomics” to express and encompass the positive economic news—and there’s a lot of it—that he hopes will lift him to reelection.Also recently unveiled—not by Biden, but about him, and presumably against his preferences—is the existence of four-year-old Navy Joan Roberts, a grandchild of the president whom he has never publicly acknowledged.*Why do I juxtapose these two seemingly unrelated developments? Because they may not be so unrelated after all. The media coverage of both tells us a lot about the political culture we...*CENTER*President Joe Biden has once again refused to acknowledge Hunter Biden's 4-year-old daughter with a stripper in a speech.On Thursday, Biden spoke to his staffers' children on Take Our Kids to Work Day. During his speech, Biden claimed he had only had six grandchildren, leaving out Navy Joan Roberts, his seventh grandchild.The 4-year-old child is Hunter's daughter with Lunden Roberts, a former exotic dancer.

Should Hunter Biden be the Focus of House GOP Investigations?
*LEFT*It’s not Hunter Biden’s scalp they want. Rather, the House GOP caucus is poised to launch a two-year crusade to tarnish President Joe Biden’s character—and lower his poll numbers—just like they did with Hillary Clinton and the Benghazi hearings prior to her 2016 candidacy.But things are different this time around—Democrats aren’t going to assume that voters can see through the partisan bluster, and are mounting a war room operation outside the White House. The Congressional Integrity Project (a pointed moniker, to be sure) will try to fend off the...*CENTER*The 1980s TV crime drama Hunter featured an eponymous main character who popularized the catchphrase, “Works for me.” Today’s crime drama surrounding Hunter Biden evokes a different repeated utterance: “Who did Hunter work for?”The troubled presidential scion is in the news again and raising questions about his father, President Joe Biden. This unwanted attention has also renewed questions about the media’s relative lack of interest in the younger Biden’s highly questionable business interests during the 2020 presidential election.Last week, Politico reported: “The New York Times is still digging...*RIGHT*As a tactical concern, the House GOP’s decision to open an investigation into Biden family corruption is questionable. It promises limited political return. It would serve Republicans, and the country, far better if the House focused on a hyper-politicized Justice Department that targets the political opposition, labels concerned parents “domestic terrorists” and ignores violence aimed at pregnancy centers, for starters.None of that, however, means there isn’t sufficient circumstantial evidence suggesting President Joe Biden not only lied about knowing his son was favor-trading on the family name with corrupt autocracies...
Biden Announces Next Steps in ‘Cancer Moonshot’ Initiative

Biden Says Texas Abortion Ban Will Cause 'Unconstitutional Chaos'
*LEFT*A new Texas law that effectively bans most abortions prompted President Joe Biden on Wednesday to use a word he'd entirely avoided as president: "Abortion."The absence of the word in Biden's public remarks and statements has frustrated activists, who say it reflects an issue that fell off the priority list even as women's right to an abortion comes under threat in states across the Midwest and South.The Supreme Court on Wednesday night formally denied a request from Texas abortion providers to freeze the state law, meaning it will remain on the books for now. Abortion providers...*CENTER*A Texas law imposing a near-total ban on abortion that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed to stand will cause "unconstitutional chaos" by infringing on a right that women have exercised for almost a half-century, President Joe Biden warned on Thursday.The court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, also raised questions about how it will rule on a more sweeping upcoming case that could curb abortion rights nationwide, as it left in place the ban on abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy.Texas' ban has so far survived legal challenges partly because...*RIGHT*President Biden on Thursday slammed the Supreme Court’s overnight ruling to allow Texas' "extreme" law that bans most abortions to remain in effect as an "unprecedented assault on a woman’s constitutional rights." In a strongly worded statement Thursday, the president reacted to the Supreme Court’s 5-4 ruling to allow Texas’ law to remain in effect. The law, signed by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they’re pregnant.
