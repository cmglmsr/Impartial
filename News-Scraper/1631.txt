*LEFT*The Securities and Exchange Committee filed a lengthy lawsuit against Coinbase on Tuesday, accusing the largest crypto exchange in the US of operating as an illegal, unregistered broker and exchange for its crypto exchange, Coinbase Prime, and its Coinbase Wallet. The legal action comes less than 24 hours after the SEC filed a separate suit against Binance accusing it of running an illegal crypto scheme and engaging in “an extensive web of deception.” It’s only Tuesday, but it’s already looking like one of the shakiest weeks for the crypto industry since last year’s dramatic FTX meltdown. Binance saw hundreds...*CENTER*The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued U.S crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) on allegations of violating federal securities law, a day after filing a similar suit against Binance.According to the SEC, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency simultaneously, arguing that it solicited customers, handled orders, allowed for bids and acted as an intermediary all at once.

How Concerning is the United States' $33 Trillion National Debt?
*LEFT*The federal debt is as old as the nation, and adding to it is sometimes prudent. For governments confronting existential crises like wars or pandemics, borrowing makes sense as a way to mobilize national resources, as the economist Barry Eichengreen wrote in the 2021 book “In Defense of Public Debt.” Government borrowing and spending are necessary to stimulate the economy during recessions. And Treasuries, safe and liquid, play a critical role in the global financial system — so much so that in the late 1990s, when a period of economic...*CENTER*The U.S. national debt is sitting at nearly $33 trillion dollars.Every year since 2001, the U.S. government has spent more money than it takes in, which means it has to borrow money to make up for the difference.“Debt has many useful purposes,” said Kris Mitchener, professor of economics at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University. “The public debt has always been used for emergencies. It’s easier to finance by borrowing than to burden the current generation with taxes.”The national debt increased by more than...*RIGHT*Washington is girding for a spending showdown, as Republicans and Democrats strategize on how to get more of what they want from a divided Congress. But whatever happens in the political drama, the budget reality not to forget is that the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month is officially projected to be $1.7 trillion, or about $13,500 for every U.S. household.The estimate is from the Congressional Budget Office’s monthly report for August, and it’s even worse than that headline.

A closer look at the historical record might indicate the source of concern, according to one Wall Street analyst.For equities, there is “good” inflation and “bad” inflation, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a Thursday note. Good inflation lifts corporate earnings as long as employment remains high; bad inflation causes recessions, undercutting corporate earnings.“Markets are volatile because they’re not sure which sort of...*RIGHT*Although inflationary pressures keep building in the U.S. economy, economists believe the Federal Reserve officials are unlikely to tighten monetary policy before seeing significant improvement in labor market recovery.From gas to groceries, Americans have started to see price increases in recent weeks as the economy reopens.

GOP, White House Spar Over Student Loan Forgiveness
