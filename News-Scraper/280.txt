After Abortion Pill Ruling, What’s Next For Abortion Access in the US?
*LEFT*A federal judge in Texas has taken a shocking and irresponsible action: invalidating the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, a medication used safely by hundreds of thousands of women each year to help terminate pregnancies as part of a two-pill regimen. For what appears to be the first time, a court has invalidated an agency drug approval — an approval that was based on extensive review of scientific evidence, earned the unanimous support of outside experts and retains, after two decades, the full backing of major professional medical...*CENTER*The legality of abortion drug mifepristone is now in doubt after a conservative judge ruled Friday to block its federal approvals—which could have impacts beyond abortion, as mifepristone and other medications that can terminate a pregnancy can also be used for a range of other medical conditions, and those treatments may be affected by the court’s ruling and ongoing attacks on the drugs.Medication abortion is traditionally a regimen involving two drugs: mifepristone, which terminates a pregnancy by blocking the hormone progesterone, and misoprostol, which induces contractions to expel the...*RIGHT*In 2000, in the last months of the Clinton administration, the Food and Drug Administration approved the mifepristone-based abortion pill commonly known as RU-486 or Mifeprex. From the beginning, the pill was given favored regulatory treatment, with accelerated approval under Subpart H, a program designed for emergency AIDS drugs. Utilizing this fast-track approval process required the FDA to characterize pregnancy, preposterously, as a “serious or life-threatening illness.”A legal challenge was filed with the FDA in 2002, as is generally required before filing suit, and the agency sat on it...
Rep. Tim Murphy to Retire Amid Scandal
*LEFT*Hypocrisy sucks, but unveiling it can feel as satisfying as taking a gigantic gulp of ice-cold nervous sweat from the brow of a very bad man. Such is the sensation that the reporters at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette must be experiencing in the wake of the marvelous scoop they published Tuesday afternoon: Rep. Tim Murphy, a vocally anti-abortion congressman from Pennsylvania, asked his own girlfriend to terminate a pregnancy this year.*CENTER*U.S. Republican Representative Tim Murphy will resign from Congress on Oct. 21, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday, following a report alleging that Murphy had asked a woman with whom he was having an affair to get an abortion.*RIGHT*Rep. Tim Murphy resigned his seat in Congress Thursday, days after court documents revealed the conservative Republican urged a mistress to obtain an abortion.
Arkansas Abortion Law
*LEFT*Overriding a veto by Arkansas' Democratic governor, the state's Republican-controlled House and Senate approved a bill to ban abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, the most restrictive such law in the country.
Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, vetoed the bill Monday, saying it "blatantly contradicts the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court."
But on Wednesday, the Arkansas House voted 56-33 to override the veto, following a 20-14 override vote a day earlier in the state Senate.*CENTER*Arkansas lawmakers voted Wednesday to bar most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, overriding a veto by the state's governor to set the most-stringent abortion restrictions in the nation.The Arkansas House of Representatives voted 56 to 33 to enact the legislation, a day after the Senate voted 20 to 14 in favor of overruling Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe. Both chambers are controlled by Republicans, although six Democratic representatives were among the House members who voted to uphold the measure."If I say that I'm pro-life, at some point I...*RIGHT*Well Arkansas has officially become the state with the most restrictive abortion law and has made a case for life. The new law is a near-ban on abortion after the 12th week of pregnancy. Unless a lawsuit or court action intervenes before it takes effect this summer, it looks like Arkansas will become the toughest state to get an abortion after the 3 month mark.Lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Legislature defied Gov. Mike Beebe, overriding the Democrat's veto. The House voted 56-33 on Wednesday to override Beebe's veto, a day...
Ohio Republicans Seek Rule Change to Block Abortion Ballot Measure
*LEFT*In the 14 months since the U.S. Supreme Court gutted abortion access in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization by overturning Roe v. Wade, one thing has become clear: The Supreme Court was out of step with a strong majority of Americans who believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases and are willing to fight to reassert their rights. And nowhere is this more evident than recent state ballot initiatives regarding abortion.In 2022, six states supported abortion rights on the ballot—a direct rejection of the Supreme Court’s overreach in Dobbs. In California and...*CENTER*A pro-choice referendum looked poised to win in the conservative state of Ohio this November. Now, Republican state legislators are accused of moving the goalposts.Last summer, just like every summer for the past 22 years, Michael Curtin spent his days on the assorted baseball fields of central Ohio, acting as umpire for high school and college games.Mr Curtin, retired after a 38-year career in journalism and another four in state politics, loves the game. But this summer, Mr Curtin's umpire equipment has been neglected, shoved somewhere in the...*RIGHT*Ohio voters head to the polls this coming Tuesday, August 8, to vote on “Issue 1”—whether to raise the threshold to change the state constitution via ballot initiative from the current simple-majority requirement to 60 percent of votes cast. The imminent significance of the August vote is a deceptively framed ballot measure to be decided in November. In that upcoming election, the vote will determine whether Ohio will add a radical pro-abortion amendment to the state’s constitution.Conventional wisdom holds that the August effort to raise the threshold is very unlikely to...
Biden Faces Pressure From Democrats To Take Stronger Abortion Stance
*LEFT*Three days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, President Biden used a break between Group of Seven summit meetings at the luxury Schloss Elmau resort in Germany to get an update on the stunning and sudden loss of abortion rights for millions of Americans back home.Huddling with top aides, including some who dialed in from the White House, Biden declared at the outset of the call that he wanted to endorse ending the Senate filibuster to codify Roe into law, a position he so far had refused to take, angering...*CENTER*President Joe Biden signed an executive order Friday that attempts to bolster women’s access to contraception and abortion medication and protect their medical privacy two weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion.But the president’s order does not restore abortion rights in the states that have banned the procedure — or soon will. Nor does it appear to affect Florida’s 15-week abortion ban, which took effect July 1.Biden, acting as pressure mounts from Democrats and abortion rights advocates, directed the U.S. Department of...*RIGHT*President Biden blasted last month’s Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade as “an exercise in raw political power” and a “giant step backwards” Friday before signing an executive order meant to help women seeking the procedure — though it is unlikely to have much effect in practice.“This was not a decision driven by the Constitution,” Biden said of the June 24 high court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which struck down the 49-year-old precedent set by Roe. “Let me say it again. This was not a decision driven...
How Does Oklahoma's Abortion Ban Strengthen Efforts Against Roe v Wade?
*LEFT*When the history of how American women lost their reproductive rights is written, the bill-signing that took place in Oklahoma City on Tuesday should be acknowledged as a key moment when the shrinking window of possibility that the Supreme Court might hold back from overturning Roe v. Wade essentially closed forever.The occasion was Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) signing a bill outlawing almost all abortions in the state, a move that is as plainly unconstitutional as it would be for the state to make it illegal to practice Judaism or criticize the president.Why...*CENTER*In the game of up-the-ante that Republican-controlled states are playing in their zeal to eradicate abortion rights, Oklahoma took the lead this week. Its new law doesn’t bother with heartbeat standards or clever enforcement mechanisms but just says it outright: Any doctor who performs any abortion at any time (other than to save a woman’s life) could face 10 years in prison. This is the oppression that awaits women throughout red-state America should the U.S. Supreme Court dismantle Roe v. Wade.That landmark 1973 case established the right of women to determine...*RIGHT*Performing an abortion in Oklahoma will be a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison under a bill signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday — just three days after lawmakers in Maryland went the other direction by expanding not only who can perform abortions but also requiring insurance to cover the procedure at no cost to the policyholder.The new laws in Oklahoma and Maryland reflect a rapidly splintering legal landscape as Republican-controlled states enact abortion restrictions while Democratic-run states race to codify abortion rights....
Where Does Biden Stand on Abortion?
*LEFT*President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Congress to pass legislation codifying Roe v. Wade and said a woman's right to have an abortion is "fundamental," but said he wasn't ready to call for an end to the filibuster to push for abortion rights legislation."Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned," Biden said in a statement after Politico published a draft of a Supreme Court majority opinion that would strike down Roe v. Wade....*CENTER*President Biden’s longtime discomfort with the issue of abortion, fueled by his Catholicism and his personal and complex stance on access, has come under scrunity this week with the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that shows a majority of justices supporting the reversal of Roe v. Wade.The president is often criticized for attempting to balance his faith with his support for abortion access. But Biden hasn’t publicaly used the word abortion out loud during his presidency until this week and he also hasn’t called for an end to the...*RIGHT*Predictably, President Biden has had nothing meaningful to say about the outrageous, criminal leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion, but he has been quick to demagogue the justices in the putative Court majority for overturning Roe and Casey, as well as Republicans and abortion opponents. What’s at stake, the president says, is “about a lot more than abortion,” and he warned that “this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization in recent American history.”Putting aside that widespread, vibrant opposition to the taking of unborn life long predates the political emergence of Donald Trump and his...

Perspectives: Supreme Court to Hear Challenge to Roe v. Wade
*LEFT*In anticipation of the Supreme Court’s hearing on Wednesday to consider Mississippi’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks, there has been much conversation about what will happen if the court’s conservatives overrule abortion rights cemented in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In fact, the implications of such a ruling would go far beyond just abortion.In Casey, the Supreme Court formulated an “undue burden” test to limit state regulation of abortion up to viability of a fetus, replacing the trimester formulation under Roe. But Casey also left a long trail of case law that...*CENTER*When he ran for president in 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump promised to nominate Supreme Court justices who would vote to end the constitutional right to an abortion. During his four years in office, Trump placed three justices – Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett – on the court, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority. With that majority in place, conservatives hope, and liberals fear, that the court will renounce nearly five decades of abortion jurisprudence and overturn the landmark rulings of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health...*RIGHT*The Supreme Court this week will hear arguments in the most consequential abortion case since Roe v. Wade. The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, presents the court with the opportunity to overturn Roe and correct one of greatest acts of judicial arrogance in history.   The conventional wisdom is that overturning Roe would cause massive societal upheaval and indelibly damage the court’s legitimacy. In fact, the reality is just the opposite. Overturning Roe will only strengthen the court’s integrity, while perpetuating Roe’s constitutional error under outside pressure would confirm criticisms that the justices are behaving...
Biden Administration Says Physicians Must Provide Abortions in Medical Emergencies
*LEFT*The Biden administration released updated guidance on Monday, reminding doctors around the country that they’re protected by federal law if they terminate a patient’s pregnancy as part of treatment in an emergency circumstance — and threatening to fine or strip the Medicare status from hospitals that fail to do so.The action, announced just over two weeks after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, comes in response to reports of widespread confusion in states that have enacted bans about when doctors can perform abortions without risking prosecution. It’s one of...*CENTER*Physicians must provide abortions in medical emergencies under federal law and will face penalties if they decline to offer the procedure in these cases, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra wrote in a letter to health-care providers on Monday.Becerra said federal law pre-empts state abortion bans in cases where women face medical emergencies associated with pregnancy under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. If an abortion is necessary to treat a woman facing a medical emergency, physicians must offer the procedure, the health secretary wrote.Hospitals...*RIGHT*The Biden administration said Monday that hospitals must ensure patients can receive abortions when deemed medically necessary in emergency situations in spite of bans in many states on the procedure in most cases.The Department of Health and Human Services said a federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, stipulates that physicians must perform an abortion in an emergency regardless of state law."Under the law, no matter where you live, women have the right to emergency care — including abortion care,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Today, in no uncertain...
Supreme Court Temporarily Blocks Ruling Revoking Abortion Pill Authorization

Democrats Urge Google to Update Abortion Searches Suggesting 'Fake Clinics'
*LEFT*U.S. lawmakers are questioning Google over how the company’s search engine shows users in certain states inaccurate results about abortion services by diverting them to “fake clinics” that don’t provide the procedure and dissuade people from ending a pregnancy.In a letter sent Friday to Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, 20 Democratic members of Congress and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) urged the company to quickly rectify the search accuracy issue, noting it comes as a U.S. Supreme Court decision due later this month could overturn the right...*CENTER*U.S. lawmakers urged Alphabet Inc's leading Google search engine to give accurate results to people seeking abortions rather than sometimes sending them to "crisis pregnancy centers," which steer woman away from the procedures.The request came in a letter, whose top signatories were Senator Mark Warner and Representative Elissa Slotkin, sent to Google on Friday and first reported by Reuters.The letter was prompted by a study released last week by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate. The study found that 11% of the results for a search for an...*RIGHT*Over 20 House and Senate Democrats have demanded the top executive at Google restrict search engine results showing pro-life pregnancy centers.The lawmakers called pregnancy centers that do not offer abortions “fake clinics.”In a letter to Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai, the lawmakers wrote, “Directing women towards fake clinics that traffic in misinformation and don’t provide comprehensive health services is dangerous to women’s health and undermines the integrity of Google’s search results.”The letter, which was spearheaded by Sen.

Alabama Senate Passes Bill Banning Nearly All Abortions
*LEFT*Alabama sent the most restrictive abortion bill in the country to the governor's desk Tuesday night, with the state's Senate passing legislation that could punish doctors who perform abortions with life in prison.The state's Republican backers have pushed the legislation, which amounts to a near-total ban on abortion in the state, forward with the express goal of overturning Roe v.

Alabama lawmakers join legislators in several other states in putting forth legislation to restrict abortion, such as Georgia's recent fetal heartbeat bill....*CENTER*The Alabama Senate on Tuesday evening passed legislation that bans nearly all abortions in the state, sending the measure to Gov. Kay Ivey's (R) desk to be signed into law.Ivey has not said whether she will sign the measure, which passed by a 25-6 margin. It would ban abortions in virtually all instances in Alabama, including for victims of rape and incest, and would only permit the procedure if necessary to save a mother’s life.Anyone performing an abortion could be punished by 10 to 99 years in...*RIGHT*The Alabama Senate on Tuesday passed the country’s most restrictive ban on abortion, outlawing the practice even in cases of rape and incest and providing an exception only when the life of the mother is in danger.The measure, one of several proposals to curb abortion being pushed in various states, could ultimately spark a legal battle that paves the way for a new challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v.

Texas Doctor Sued After Providing Abortion in Defiance of New Law

How Will Companies Be Able To Cover Abortion Travel Costs?
*LEFT*Companies stepping up to say that they will support their workers in accessing abortions after the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down Roe v. Wade raises questions both logistical and existential. For example, do you really want to ask your boss at Dick’s Sporting Goods for $4,000 and a couple of days off to terminate a pregnancy? If you start to think about the situation beyond the press release, it can get pretty disturbing pretty quickly. It reinforces how supremely screwed up the entire post-Roe situation is, as well as the setup of the United...*CENTER*The US Supreme Court’s reversal of the constitutional right to an abortion has handed an instant challenge to business leaders, caught between their fear of reprisals for taking sides on a polarising topic and their employees’ dependence on company-issued health insurance.“The ultimate result is chaos for employers that typically operate in multiple states,” given the expectation that many states will now pass sweeping abortion bans, said Jen Stark, co-director of the centre for business and social justice at BSR, which advises businesses on how to navigate their social responsibilities....*RIGHT*Rather than pay for maternity leave, a laundry list of woke U.S. corporations (who until recently flaunted Pride-themed logos) are cutting costs by offering chump change so their pregnant employees can travel across state lines to abort their babies.

Roe v Wade Protests Move to Homes of Supreme Court Justices
*LEFT*Centrist and conservative commentators are saying the recent pro-abortion rights protests outside the houses of conservative Supreme Court justices have crossed a line. These are mobs of harassers who have breached the acceptable parameters of protest, critics contend. But such arguments rest in large part on the myth of an apolitical judiciary. Looked at another way, the protests are salutary rather than destructive, bringing something to bear upon the court that by design it has been always been shielded from: democratic energy.The leaked draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v.

The States Poised to Restrict or Outlaw Abortion
*LEFT*The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in a 5-1-3 decision in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization on Friday. Abortion will now be heavily restricted or completely banned in about half of the U.S.’s 50 states.But changes to legal access to abortion, while radical and widespread, will happen unevenly under a patchwork of varying state laws. Overturning Roe just means states are free to decide how to, or if, to allow access to abortion services. Sixteen states will immediately, or in short order, ban abortions in...*CENTER*On June 24, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v.

Proposed Abortion Bans Fail in 2 States as Some Republicans Break From Party
*LEFT*Measures that would have severely restricted abortion failed Thursday in Nebraska and South Carolina, which both have Republican-controlled legislatures, a reflection of the growing unease among Republicans over the political popularity of strict bans.In Nebraska, a “Heartbeat Act” would have banned most abortions after six weeks except in cases of rape or incest or to preserve the life of the mother once a “fetal heartbeat” was detected, but it stalled in the legislature. A vote to overcome a filibuster of the bill failed by a vote of 32-15, with two...*CENTER*The South Carolina state Senate rejected a near-total abortion ban on Thursday, after the chamber’s five female lawmakers led a multiday filibuster against the bill.Three Republicans, a Democrat and an Independent joined together as the only five women in the state Senate to block the legislation, which sought to ban abortion from conception with exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal anomalies and to save the life of the mother. The bill ultimately failed in a 22-21 vote on Thursday. This is the third time that a near-total abortion ban...*RIGHT*Nearing the end of their respective legislative sessions, Republican state senators in South Carolina and Nebraska on Thursday helped to torpedo pro-life bills that would have significantly restricted abortion in those conservative states.Nebraska’s bill, which would have banned abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected around six weeks of pregnancy, died in a 32-15 filibuster-ending cloture vote, the Omaha World-Herald reported.Veteran GOP state Senator Merv Riepe denied the 33rd vote needed for the bill to pass, abstaining over fears that it would be interpreted as a total ban on the procedure.“At the end...

Texas Abortion Rate Dropped Nearly 60% After Heartbeat Act Took Effect
*LEFT*Abortions performed by registered providers in Texas fell by 60% in the first month after the state passed the most restrictive abortion law in the US in decades, according to new figures.Nearly 2,200 abortions were reported by Texas providers in September after a new law took effect that bans the procedure once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy and when many do not know they are pregnant.

Perspectives: New Texas Abortion Law
*LEFT*The cry of "Freedom!" echoes across the land, rising from places like Texas, controlled by Republican officials who are using every tool at their disposal to ban mask mandates or vaccine requirements. It's curious, then, that as of Wednesday morning, the women of Texas are essentially banned from choosing to get an abortion.The same politicians who declare that mask requirements are an intolerable intrusion by government into sacrosanct individual freedom, have just imposed the country's most restrictive abortion law since the Supreme Court made abortion legal in the landmark 1973 decision, Roe v....*CENTER*Abortion has long been a contentious issue in the United States, and it is one that sharply divides Americans along partisan, ideological and religious lines.Today, a 59% majority of U.S. adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 39% think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. These views are relatively unchanged in the past few years. The latest Pew Research Center survey, conducted April 5 to 11, finds deep disagreement between – and within – the parties over abortion. In fact, the partisan divide...*RIGHT*Just before midnight, the Supreme Court, over the incoherent objections of four dissenting justices, denied the request by Texas abortion providers for emergency relief against the Texas Heartbeat Act.

ACLU, Planned Parenthood Amongst Plaintiffs in Lawsuit Against Alabama's New Abortion Law

It’s the first step in what promises to be a long legal battle over whether to let the ban go into effect.Under Alabama’s law, abortions would only be allowed if a pregnancy posed a “serious health risk” to the mother. There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and abortion providers could spend up to 99 years in prison for performing the procedure.If that sounds unconstitutionally...*CENTER*(Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging a law enacted by Alabama last week that bans nearly all abortions and makes performing the procedure a felony punishable by up to 99 years in prison.The lawsuit is one of several the groups have filed or are preparing to file against states that recently passed strict anti-abortion measures in an effort to prompt the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v.

In at least one earlier ad, the Obama campaign charged that Mitt Romney is opposed to all abortion.*RIGHT*Rattled by recent polling showing Mitt Romney drawing roughly even with President Obama among female voters, Democrats are making yet another hard play over "ladyparts."

Texas and Ohio Supreme Courts Block Orders to Reinstate Abortion Access

Supreme Court to Overturn Roe v Wade, Draft Opinion Shows
*LEFT*The Supreme Court has voted to strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, according to an initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito circulated inside the court and obtained by POLITICO.The draft opinion is a full-throated, unflinching repudiation of the 1973 decision which guaranteed federal constitutional protections of abortion rights and a subsequent 1992 decision – Planned Parenthood v. Casey – that largely maintained the right. “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Alito writes.*CENTER*The Supreme Court has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, according to a copy of an apparent draft opinion obtained by Politico.Obtained by reporters Josh Gerstein and Alexander Ward, the 98-page draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito is dated Feb. 10, 2022. It is styled as the “opinion of the Court” in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, in which Mississippi and its supporters have asked the justices to eliminate the constitutional right to abortion that was first established by Roe in 1973 and re-affirmed by Casey in 1992.*RIGHT*The Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, according to a bombshell new report from Politico.A draft decision from Justice Samuel Alito obtained by the outlet states that “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start.

The Roe v Wade Supreme Court Leak: Is it a Crime?

Idaho Supreme Court Temporarily Blocks Abortion Ban That Resembles Texas Heartbeat Act
*LEFT*The Idaho Supreme Court on Friday temporarily blocked the state’s new six-week abortion ban, which mimics a controversial Texas law.Abortion providers had said in a lawsuit filed last week that the Idaho law violates several provisions of the state constitution and asked the state Supreme Court to intervene before April 22, when the law had been set to take effect.The court on Friday granted a motion to reconsider, and said that the “implementation of Senate Bill 1309 is stayed pending further action by this Court.”Last month, Idaho had become the...*CENTER*The Idaho Supreme Court on Friday put a stay on the state’s controversial new abortion law, set to go into effect later this month, pending a lawsuit filed last week by Planned Parenthood.Idaho’s law, inspired by Texas legislation, would ban most abortions after about six weeks and allow certain family members to sue abortion providers for at least $20,000.

DeSantis Signs New Florida Abortion Restrictions Into Law

What Does Kansas' Abortion Vote Mean for the 2022 Elections?
*LEFT*Donald Trump won Kansas by a 15-point margin in 2020, sweeping 100 of the state’s 105 counties as the presidential candidate of a Republican Party that has for decades pledged to overturn the Roe v.

*LEFT*On Tuesday, Ohio voters overwhelmingly rejected Issue 1, a ballot measure designed to take power away from voters. It’s just the latest in a series of examples of how the Republican Party’s hostility toward abortion rights may be unwittingly motivating even moderate and center-right voters to support abortion access.It’s the Streisand Effect, brought to us by Samuel Alito.Issue 1 would have raised the threshold of victory for public referendums in the Buckeye State from 50 percent plus one vote to 60 percent, and make it more difficult for...*CENTER*The huge voter turnout against a special ballot measure in Ohio that would have made it tougher to protect abortion rights is setting off alarm bells among Republican strategists who say abortion will be problem for their party in 2024.  Republicans hope to win back control of the Senate and keep their House majority but acknowledge abortion politics will “complicate” their chances of winning key races in even conservative-leaning states, such as Montana and Ohio, where Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) are up for reelection.  ...*RIGHT*On Tuesday, Ohio voters decisively rejected a proposal to make amending its state constitution harder. Issue 1 sought to require a 60% threshold for changing Ohio’s constitution rather than the current rules mandating only a majority vote.I noted the problem with these efforts months ago in the pages of this publication . The immediate problem continues to be the timing of the effort. This fall, Ohio voters will consider another amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in that state’s fundamental law. Many voters saw Issue 1 as an attempt...
Texas Debates Abortion
*LEFT*Democrats are gearing up to spend millions of dollars to “turn Texas blue” by bringing in a new generation of Latino voters.
So when an abortion fight flared in Austin this summer, it seemed the stars had aligned — liberals had a hot-button cause to galvanize new supporters who just might stick around for the long haul.*CENTER*Texas Governor Rick Perry Sunday expressed confidence the state legislature, convened for a new special session, will pass an abortion law blocked last month by a filibuster.“Texas is a place where we defend life,” Mr. Perry said about the legislation that would establish new abortion restrictions on “Fox News Sunday.”*RIGHT*The battle to ban abortions after five months continues today in Texas. The Texas Senate Committee on Health and Human Services is expected to hold a hearing on HB2 Monday, a bill requiring abortion clinics meet basic medical standards while banning abortions after 20 weeks. The legislation is a duplicate of SB5, which was defeated through filibuster and a rowdy protest crowd two weeks ago.
Pelosi Says House Democrats Are Looking To Codify Federal Abortion Protections
*LEFT*House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday outlined House Democrats' legislative response to Roe v. Wade being overturned, saying her party is looking at codifying a federal right to an abortion.Pelosi outlined three areas that House Democrats are examining just days after the Supreme Court gutted federal abortion rights, overturning nearly over a half-century of precedent. These are: protecting sensitive data on reproductive health apps, making it clear that states cannot stop people from traveling to seek an abortion, and once again trying to pass a federal law guaranteeing a...*CENTER*House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday said the chamber’s Democrats are exploring legislation to protect personal data stored on reproductive health apps, ensure the right to free travel between states and codify the right to an abortion after the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v.

On Monday, she said the House would take up legislation to codify other matters decided by the high court and would again consider the Women’s Health Protection Act, a sweeping abortion rights bill that passed the House and failed in the Senate.In a Dear...
Supreme Court to Review Birth Control Mandate
*LEFT*The U.S. Supreme Court announced on Tuesday that it will take up the question of whether a for-profit company can refuse to cover contraception for its employees because of religious objections.Dozens of companies have sued the Obama administration over a rule in the Affordable Care Act requiring most employers -- with the exception of churches and religious non-profits -- to cover the full range of contraceptives in their health insurance plans. The Supreme Court will hear the most high-profile case, filed by the Christian-owned craft supply chain Hobby Lobby,...*CENTER*The Supreme Court said Tuesday it would decide whether for-profit employers can invoke their religious beliefs to deny contraceptive coverage to female employees who would otherwise be entitled to it under the Affordable Care Act, in a new case before the high court challenging part of President Barack Obama's health-care overhaul.The 2010 federal law, most of which the high court upheld in June 2012, includes contraceptive coverage among the minimum package of benefits insurance policies must include. The Obama administration has exempted religiously affiliated nonprofit employers, such as Catholic...*RIGHT*The Supreme Court set up another showdown over President Obama’s health care law on Tuesday by taking on a pair of cases that challenge an administrative rule requiring many for-profit companies to insure birth control.Hobby Lobby stores and Conestoga Wood Specialties are among dozens of large firms with religiously devout owners who say the “contraception mandate” tied to the Affordable Care Act infringes on their First Amendment right to religious freedom.
Denying Abortion Medication Could Violate Civil Rights Laws, Biden Admin Tells Pharmacies
*LEFT*Senior Biden administration officials announced Wednesday that they are reminding tens of thousands of pharmacies around the country that they risk violating civil rights laws if they refuse to fill orders for contraception or abortion medication or discriminate based on a person’s pregnancy status.The action comes a few weeks after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave more than a dozen states a green light to ban abortion, and aims to respond to a wave of reports that pharmacies in those states are refusing to not only fill prescriptions for abortion...*CENTER*The Health and Human Services Department on Wednesday warned U.S. retail pharmacies that they risk violating civil rights law if they deny access to medication used in abortions under certain circumstances.The HHS Office for Civil Rights said pharmacies cannot deny access to prescription medication used for reproductive health care on the basis of the customer’s sex, pregnancy status and other protected groups under federal discrimination laws.This may include the prescription of the abortion pill, mifepristone used in combination with misoprostol, to assist with first-trimester miscarriages. The medication can...*RIGHT*The Biden administration is warning retail pharmacies against denying patients abortion-inducing medication, saying this would violate anti-discrimination laws by withholding healthcare from pregnant people.The Department of Health and Human Services’s Office for Civil Rights has released guidelines reinforcing the Obamacare law that warns more than 60,000 U.S. pharmacies against refusing to dispense abortion-inducing medication, stipulating that doing so is pregnancy discrimination.

American Views on Abortion and Policy One Year After the Overturning of Roe v. Wade
*LEFT*Activists and politicians are marking the one-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that overturned a nationwide right to abortion by both bashing and celebrating it.Rallies on both sides were scheduled for Saturday in Washington and across the country.In a statement, President Joe Biden pledged to protect access and decried the court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The court’s conservative majority on June 24, 2022, overturned the Roe v. Wade decision, which had been in place for nearly a half-century.“States have imposed extreme and dangerous...*CENTER*It’s been a year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and polling suggests Americans’ views on abortion have shifted among some groups but remain unchanged for others.Since the SCOTUS ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 14 states have banned most abortions. Now, more residents in those states think it should be easier to get an abortion, according to a recent Pew Research survey. The percentage who said so jumped from 31% in 2019 to 43% in April.But the same poll found 80% of Americans’ views...*RIGHT*A year after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, legal abortions across the United States are down 3%, as several states have either limited or banned abortion access.The Supreme Court's decision, made on June 24, 2022, paved the way for all 50 states to make decisions on limiting abortion, with several Republican states implementing restrictions in the year since the historic decision. The limiting of access to abortion in several Republican states has led to an increase in the number of abortions practiced in Democratic states, according to Axios.Planned Parenthood of Illinois experienced a 54% increase in abortion patients over...
Supreme Court Strikes Down Louisiana Abortion Restrictions
*LEFT*The case, over a state law requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, is the first abortion ruling since two Trump appointees joined the court.The Supreme Court on Monday struck down a Louisiana law that could have left the state with a single abortion clinic.The vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voting with the court’s four-member liberal wing but not adopting its reasoning. The chief justice said respect for precedent compelled him to vote with the majority.The...*CENTER*The Supreme Court on Monday voted 5-4 to strike down a restrictive Louisiana abortion measure in a major win for reproductive rights activists, with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the court’s four liberals.Justice Stephen Breyer, who authored an opinion joined by his fellow Democratic appointees, wrote that the law placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. Roberts wrote separately to say his thinking was based on the court’s 2016 decision to strike down a similar law in Texas.The case involved a Louisiana abortion law requiring...*RIGHT*The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that a Louisiana law requiring that individuals who perform abortions at clinics have admitting privileges in a nearby hospital is unconstitutional, as it places an undue burden on women seeking abortions.The court ruled 5-4 in the case, June Medical Services LLC v.

Abortion Pill Ruling Could End FDA Approval of Key Drug
*LEFT*A federal judge in Texas is likely to rule soon in a case that could halt distribution of a key abortion drug — a decision that would have sweeping implications for abortion access across the country, including in Democratic-led states where abortion rights are protected.The lawsuit, filed by several antiabortion groups and doctors against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, aims to undo the decades-old government approval of mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion.If the judge in the case, Matthew Kacsmaryk of the Northern District of Texas,...*CENTER*In stories about medication abortions, we often give mifepristone a starring role. We call the dashing biochemist who developed it “the father of the abortion pill,” noting his youth spent in the French Resistance and his glamorous, Vanity-Fair-worthy flings. We see it in the headlines pretty frequently, dragging its trusty sidekick misoprostol in tow. Later this month, a Trump-appointed judge in Texas may well ban it from the sanctioned market by ordering the Food and Drug Administration to overturn its approval.So it might seem surprising that American abortion providers are responding to that threatened prohibition by preparing to forego...*RIGHT*Supporters and opponents of chemical-abortion pills are bracing for a ruling in the coming days or weeks that could radically alter how abortions are performed in the United States, stemming from a lawsuit that claims that the Food and Drug Administration never had the authority to approve the use of the pills when it did so nearly a quarter century ago.The FDA also failed to properly study the safety of the two-pill regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol, and for almost two decades it stonewalled the doctors who were attempting...
Man Indicted in Rape of 10-Year Old Girl Who Traveled to Indiana for Abortion

Appeals Court Preserves Partial Access to Abortion Pill Mifepristone
*LEFT*A federal appeals court preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone for now but reduced the period of pregnancy when the drug can be used and said it could not be dispensed by mail.The ruling late Wednesday temporarily narrowed a decision by a lower court judge in Texas that had completely blocked the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the nation’s most commonly used method of abortion.

Trump Breaks Silence on Abortion Law
*LEFT*President Trump is carefully distancing himself from a new Alabama law that bans abortion in almost all circumstances, even in cases of rape and incest, stressing his “strongly pro-life” credentials while aligning himself with other Republicans who also contend the statute goes too far.
In a late-night Twitter thread Saturday, Trump avoided any direct references to the law in Alabama or in other Republican-led states that have rushed to enact strict new rules against abortion designed to invite court challenges and eventually make their way to the Supreme Court.
...*CENTER*US President Donald Trump has outlined his "strongly pro-life" views on abortion amid controversy over strict new laws passed in several states.
Mr Trump said he was against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a "serious health risk" to the mother.
His stance on what is a divisive election issue in the US emerged days after Alabama passed a law banning abortion in almost all cases.
A pro-choice rally is planned later on Sunday in protest at the new measures.*RIGHT*President Trump said he favors abortion laws that include exceptions for rape and incest, marking a break with Alabama Republicans, who recently enacted the strictest abortion ban in the nation.
“As most people know, and for those who would like to know, I am strongly Pro-Life, with the three exceptions - Rape, Incest and protecting the Life of the mother,” Trump tweeted late Saturday.
Trump said Republicans must stick together to win elections in 2020 and further the anti-abortion agenda.
Several State Courts Temporarily Block Abortion Bans

A Divided Nation Reacts to the End of Roe v Wade
*LEFT*The Supreme Court has officially overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating federal abortion protections that stood for almost 50 years. On Friday, June 24, the conservative majority released its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, confirming the outcome a leak made clear in May when Politico published a draft ruling by Justice Samuel Alito. Roe prohibited states from outlawing abortion before viability (around 24 weeks into a pregnancy) and after, in cases where pregnancy turned out to threaten the patient’s life or health. In Dobbs, Mississippi challenged those terms directly, asking the Court to uphold its 15-week ban by...*CENTER*The Supreme Court has spoken: Abortion is no longer a constitutional right. This permits states to be the ultimate arbiter of abortion, creating a red and blue collage of abortion access across the nation. Putting aside for the moment the moral, ethical and religious debates surrounding abortion, what does the data say that can help guide us as we move forward from this decision?

It has taken 49 years and five months, but the Supreme Court has finally reversed the monstrous injustice it worked in 1973. In Roe v. Wade, seven justices cast aside the laws of every state protecting unborn children from the violence of abortion, even though nothing in the text, original understanding, or history of the Constitution authorized them to do so. It was an act of “raw judicial power,” as a Democratic justice wrote in dissent, and even law professors who approved the abortion license Roe created assailed the decision for lacking any constitutional...
California Won't Do Business With Walgreens After Abortion Pill Decision
*LEFT*California Governor Gavin Newsom announced Monday that his state will no longer do business with Walgreens because the pharmacy chain decided not to dispense abortion pills.Walgreens initially said in January that it would offer mifepristone, one of the medications used to induce an abortion.

Ohio Voters Reject Issue 1 in Win for Abortion Supporters

Contradictory Injunctions Suspend, Preserve Access to Abortion Pill Mifepristone
*LEFT*Dueling, back-to-back rulings by federal judges about access to the drug mifepristone, which is used in most abortions in the United States, have raised questions about the future of reproductive health care in the country.On Friday in Texas, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled that the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone should be put on hold, more than 20 years after the agency first authorized the drug.

Hillary Speaks at Planned Parenthood
*LEFT*Hillary Clinton’s first speech since she won a majority of pledged delegates in the Democratic presidential race included remarks about how abortion relates to other issues. That’s groundbreaking for a presidential candidate.The term “reproductive justice” was promoted by the grassroots women of color collective SisterSong in the 1990s to describe “the complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic well-being” of a person. This means considering a broad array of factors that affect a person’s ability to have, not have and/or raise children.*CENTER*Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton plunged into general-election combat on Friday, and immediately showed voters the starkly different choices they represent in their views of abortion, women’s issues and the Supreme Court’s future.*RIGHT*Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, now at the starting line of a general election race, traded shots across the capital Friday in dueling addresses before two very different D.C. audiences -- each warning the other would take the country backward.Trump headlined the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s “Road to Majority” summit while Clinton addressed a Planned Parenthood national conference.
