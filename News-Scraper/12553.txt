It also puts the candidates in an awkward position, making them choose between defending and praising their rival and running the risk of further boosting his...

Perspectives: Trump Hasn't Yet Conceded the Election
*LEFT*It turns out there was a coordinated attack on the 2020 election after all. It began several years ago and accelerated in the last several months.

Liz Cheney ahead of the vote.The subpoena means that Trump has been ordered by the committee to provide relevant documents and testimony under oath as part of its investigation....*RIGHT*Donald Trump will never testify before Congress’s Jan. 6 committee, subpoena or no subpoena. He will resist it and will challenge any such subpoena in the courts — for a couple of months.Since the overwhelming likelihood is that Republicans will win control of the House in November, in one way or another, the subpoena will probably be quashed come January 2023.So the highly theatrical decision of the committee to vote (with a full roll call, like in “1776” when they sign the Declaration of Independence) to compel the former...

Perspectives: Charges Against Trump Organization

Jan. 6 Hearing Focuses on Extremist Groups
*LEFT*The day after an explosive Oval Office meeting in which a motley crew of outside advisers clashed with White House lawyers over a plan to seize voting machines, then-President Donald Trump turned his focus to riling up his supporters for the Jan. 6 push to stop the counting of electoral votes, according to evidence presented in Tuesday's House committee hearing.Two longtime Trump advisers, Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, were in contact with leaders of the violent extremist groups The Proud Boys and The Oath Keepers, according to text messages and...*CENTER*The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol played testimony describing a heated argument in which former President Donald Trump’s White House lawyers rejected claims of election fraud by Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other outside advisers.The testimony came in the committee’s seventh hearing of the year, focusing on potential connections between Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and far-right groups allegedly at the center of the day’s violence.*RIGHT*President Trump‘s proposal to appoint conservative attorney Sidney Powell as a special counsel to investigate voting fraud in the 2020 election culminated in a profane screaming match between Trump loyalists and White House advisers who opposed the plan, witnesses told the Jan. 6 committee on Tuesday.Former White House counsel Pat Cipollone was shown in video testimony saying he was “vehemently opposed” to having Ms. Powell appointed to any position in the White House.

Trump's Dinner With White Nationalist Draws Backlash From McConnell
*LEFT*Donald Trump is betting he can win his way back to the White House by reviving the outsider appeal that fueled his success in 2016.But his dinner with a Holocaust-denying white nationalist and a rapper who has spewed antisemitic conspiracies is demonstrating the risks of that approach.

Republicans Line Up to Take On Trump in 2024 Presidential Race

What Charges is Trump Potentially Facing From the Manhattan DA?

Perspectives: New York Times Report on Trump's Tax Returns
*LEFT*The explosive New York Times report on Donald Trump’s tax returns confirms a great number of things about the president’s finances we’ve only been able to speculate about for years. We now know that Trump really was telling the truth when he claimed, beginning in the 2016 presidential campaign, that he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (though such an audit would not prevent him from releasing his returns—that part he really did make up). We also now know—though we basically already did—that while Trump made a lot...*CENTER*On Sunday, a New York Times exposé on President Trump’s tax returns revealed decades of tax avoidance and millions of dollars in business losses over the past two decades. The picture painted by Trump’s returns is sharply at odds with the shrewd, deal-making image the president has tried to fashion as a real estate mogul and TV star on a show built around his business prowess, “The Apprentice.” Now, five weeks from Election Day, the question is will these new revelations affect the presidential race?There are really two parts...*RIGHT*The New York Times really needs to get its complaint straight. Apparently, President Trump is a no-good businessman who never makes any money, and so he aggressively avoids tax payments, paying just $750 in income taxes in 2016 and 2017 (if the report is true, which Trump has unsurprisingly called "fake news"). No doubt, he has to be aggressive to ensure he doesn't pay taxes on money he hasn't made. Or maybe it's all just another reason to stand in Midtown Manhattan shrieking about Trump.Because there's nothing in Trump's...

Trump denies any...*CENTER*Everyone hoping that the Manhattan District Attorney would finally take down Donald Trump was—let’s be honest—pinning their hopes on the notion that there would be a surprise dispositive smoking gun proving massive fraud. On Tuesday, those hopes failed to materialize.When the indictment was finally unsealed, we were left with charges pretty close to what everyone was already predicting: a case that is largely about falsifying business records.Most of the observers I saw were underwhelmed. “[District Attorney Alvin] Bragg explaining why it was vital to indict Trump frankly sounds...*RIGHT*Late last month I wrote exactly the kind of piece that makes every legal analyst nervous. I tried to anticipate the Manhattan grand jury’s indictment of Donald Trump and to evaluate its (likely) merits. In my view then, an indictment wouldn’t be frivolous, but it would be unwise — mainly because it was expected to rely on a largely untested legal theory that would transform the business falsification misdemeanors Trump is accused of into felonies by tying the misdemeanors to other crimes that either hadn’t been prosecuted or rest on...
