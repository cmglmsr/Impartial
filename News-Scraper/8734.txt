What's Behind Musk's Decision to Rename Twitter 'X'?
*LEFT*It’s rare for corporate brands to become so intertwined with everyday conversation that they become verbs. It’s rarer still for the owner of such a brand to announce plans to intentionally destroy it.On Sunday, in the middle of a quiet summer weekend, Elon Musk decreed that Twitter’s product name would be changed to “X,” and that he is getting rid of the bird logo and all the associated words, including “tweet.” Musk’s move wiped out anywhere between $4 billion and $20 billion in value, according to analysts and brand...*CENTER*Elon Musk recently explained why he decided to rebrand Twitter to X and noted that it’s more than just a name change.

DeSantis Signs Bill Ending Disney's Self-Governing District

Left and Right Divided After Starbucks Asks 6 Police Officers to Leave
*LEFT*It’s like the first line of a bad joke: “Six Tempe police officers go into a Starbucks …”And the punchline is even worse.An unwise decision by a single barista in a single coffee shop on a single day winds up as a triple, venti, double-shot, non-fat, caramel macchiato campaign for a national boycott.It’s time to dump the #DumpStarbucks hashtag, which never should have existed in the first place.*CENTER*I married a cop.Well, he’s a retired lawyer now, but he was all cop when I met him.

Should TikTok Be Banned in the US Over National Security Concerns?
*LEFT*Negotiations between the Biden Administration and TikTok regarding the company's data security have reportedly been delayed due to national security concerns. But the news begs the question: Why are we negotiating anything regarding TikTok when it presents such a clear national security threat?Some people have gotten the message loud and clear.
